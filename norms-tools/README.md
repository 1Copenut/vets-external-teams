## Using Slack

* **Product channel** - Your whole team will be added to a product-focused Slack channel.

  * This where you can ask questions and share **product-related information** with other teams working in a similar area.

* **Support channel** - Your whole team will be added to the *#support-external* channel.

  * This is where you can ask **process questions about onboarding, development, deployment, and project management**.

* Refer to [the communication norms](../norms-communication.md#) for the best way to use Slack to communicate with DSVA and Internal Contractors.


## Understanding Github access

The [VA Github organization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) contains many repos from teams across the VA. To make it easier for External Contractor teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform, we've listed the repos that are relevant to your work.

After your team has been added to the VA Github organization (see [External Contractor onboarding](../external-contractor-onboarding/request-access-to-tools)), your team will have access to these repos:

* [vets.gov-team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team) (private, write access)
    * We'll set up a "Product" folder for your team, which you'll use to store and share project documents.
    * Your team will use Github issues in this repo to manage your agile workflow and to request tasks from the DSVA team.
    * See [using the vets.gov-team repo](#using-the-vets-gov-team-repo).
* [vets-ato](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-ato) (private, read access)
    * Provided so your team can review the current ATO documents.
* [vets-website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-json-schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema) (public, developers have Write access)
* [vets-api-mockdata](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-mockdata) (private, developers have Read access)


## Using the vets.gov-team repo

The ```vets.gov-team``` repo contains content about the Veteran Tools Platform since its first launch.
* **Most of the folders in this repo are not relevant or useful to External Contractors.** So please don't get distracted by them!
* **External contractor teams only need to pay attention to the "Products" folder.**

### Products folder

**Action item***
* For historical and tracking purposes, your team must store its project documents in your assigned "Products" folder. If you don't know which folder that is, ask your DSVA contact.
* At a minimum, your team must store Research, Design, and Engineering documents in this folder.

### Work Practices folder

The "Work Practices" folder contains DSVA and Internal Contractor processes. These **do not apply to External Contractors**.

**Action item**
* Unless you are sent a direct link to a document in the "Work Practices" folder, **you should ignore everything in that folder.**
* If you have any questions about the processes you should follow as an External Contractor, ask your DSVA contact.

# Preliminary ATO assessment

<hr>

**Definitions for terms used in this folder:**

* *"DSVA" refers to DSVA team members and DSVA detailees.*

* *"Internal contractors" refers to DSVA's primary vendor contractor (e.g., AdHoc) and its subcontractors.*

* *"External contractors" refers to any other contractor team working on the Veteran Tools Platform.*

<hr>


The purpose of the preliminary ATO assessment is to get the ball rolling...to determine the scope of potential updates needed for the ATO based on the scope and complexity of the external contractor's project/work. The outcome of this task is that both teams understand the needs related to ATO and Security Review (and can plan timelines accordingly).

    * See [an example issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-ato/issues/318) to illustrate the kinds of information we need for this preliminary assessment.
1. DSVA will examine the existing ATO documents and determine if they need to be updated based on the information youâ€™ve provided.

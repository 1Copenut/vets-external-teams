### Request a Content QA

1. External teams write their own content.

1. Before the final QA, the external team files an issue in vets-team repo.
    * Labels: ```content-qa``` and ```external-request```
    * Assign to: ```Beth Potts```
    * Comment: ```Provides some context for the project and the content review```
      * An example here will help illustrate what we want from the external team in terms of "context"
    
1. Beth assigns the issue to an editor on her team. 

1. The editor [performs a content QA that covers these items](#content-qa-checklist).
    * Expected turnaround time is 2 business days. **We should discuss SLA as I think 2 days is not much time.**

1. The editor creates a Word doc and uses "track changes" to show where content needs to be changed.

1. The editor uploads the Word doc to the Github issue.

1. The external team makes all the changes and closes the issue.
    * Our expectation is that the external team makes **all the changes** noted in the Word doc. 
    * If the external team disagrees with a change, they can use the issue to talk about how to resolve it with the editor.

1. The external team proceeds to final QA.

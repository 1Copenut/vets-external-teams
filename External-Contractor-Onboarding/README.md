## Welcome to the Veteran Tools Platform

We're excited that your team will be building an application (or feature) on the Veteran Tools Platform! This is the place to get started with onboarding your team.

## Step 1: Understand culture

Have all team members review the:

* [Code of Conduct for working on the Veteran Tools Platform](../code-of-conduct.md)

  * If you have questions about the Code of Conduct, ask your DSVA contact.

* [Norms for communication](../Norms/communication.md)

  * Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform come from different organizations (DSVA, Internal Contractors, External Contractors).

  * Review the norms for communication so you understand how to communicate effectively with DSVA, as well as expectations for communicating and working with other VA contractors.


* [Norms for using Github](../norms-github)

  * Be sure team members review the [tips for creating a Github account](../Norms/Github/README.md#tips-for-creating-a-github-account) **before** they create a Github account in [Step #2](#step-2-request-access-to-tools).


## Step 2: Request access to tools

* [Request access to the tools](request-access-to-tools.md) your team needs to work on the Veteran Tools Platform.


## Step 3: Understand norms for using tools

* [Understand how to use the tools](../Norms/tools.md) to do your work.

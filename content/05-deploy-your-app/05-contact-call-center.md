The call center is an important resource for answering Veterans' questions and helping them navigate when they get stuck. When your user experience is in a state that shows what it will look like when it goes live, it's time to create an application guide for the call center team to help them understand the ins-and-outs of your product.

A product guide should show screenshots of each page of your user's journey, how they'll navigate to it on the site, describe the error messaging a user could face and explain any unique scenarios. Here is an [example](/va-digital-services-platform-docs/assets/launch/templates/sample_application_guide.pdf).

Send your application guide to aubrey@thesocompany.com along with an estimated timeline for when your application will go live.

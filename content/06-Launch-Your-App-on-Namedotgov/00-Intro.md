If you’d like to build and launch a new feature on [name.gov], at a high level the process looks like this:

Leverage resources in this Playbook to define the product or feature you’ll be creating
Review product documentation with **Brad Houston??** to confirm priority
Design, test, and build! Also leveraging resources in this Playbook as needed.
As you work, create issues in the [contrib] repo for questions, blockers, or feedback so the platform team can support you.
When it’s time to launch, run a go/no-go meeting to make sure all necessary parties are ready
Deploy to production for a “soft launch” and track performance and metrics
When ready, deploy supporting navigation for a “hard launch”!
Continue to monitor, and repeat this process for additional features and iterations

There’s a lot more detail, as well as step-by-step guides, that you’ll find if you browse deeper in this section.

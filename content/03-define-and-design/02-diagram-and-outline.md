## Diagraming product flows
- Map out the entire flow of the benefit. How do Veterans move from screen to screen of the product?
- What conditional logic will affect that flow?
- What external systems will be touched, and when?
- Are there points where people will move in and out of your product? Are there any pauses or waiting involved?
- How are notifications handled?
- What error states can you anticipate?


## Outlining products
- Break flow up into screens. What interactions make sense to be grouped together?
- What are the states for each screen?
- Is there contextual help you can offer to clarify decisions?

This is a good time to start looking at the Design System and looking around for ways that similar situations are being adressed elsewhere on Vets.gov. Donâ€™t unnecessarily reinvent the wheel.

## Mapping Information Architecture
Understanding the information architecture(IA) of your user experience is a critical step that affects all the subsequent decisions that happen in design and development.

One case when IA is extremely important is when transforming a paper form into a digital experience. At Vets.gov, we start by working through a paper form and mapping it out in a spreadsheet. Here is an example:
- <a href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-686c-ARE.pdf" target="blank">686 Paper Form</a>
- [686 Information Architecture Mapping](/va-digital-services-platform-docs/assets/design/templates/686-form-outline.csv)

Your information architecture mapping might look a lot different depending on the type of experience you're trying to create, but regardless, it will be extremely helpful to helpful for diagramming your user experience.

## Digram product flows
- Wire frame out the entire flow of the benefit. How do Veterans move from screen to screen of the product?
- What conditional logic will affect that flow?
- What external systems will be touched, and when?
- Are there points where people will move in and out of your product? Are there any pauses or waiting involved?
- How are notifications handled?
- What error states can you anticipate?

## Outlining products
- Break flow up into screens. What interactions make sense to be grouped together?
- What are the states for each screen?
- Is there contextual help you can offer to clarify decisions?

This is a good time to start looking at the <a href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system/" target="blank">Vets.gov Design System</a> and looking around for ways that similar situations are being addressed elsewhere on Vets.gov. Donâ€™t unnecessarily reinvent the wheel.

title: Review Discovery Findings and Scope Project
label: Review & Scope
---
Get the entire team together to review the findings of the discovery phase. Combine the user experience findings with technical discovery to get a handle on the smallest useful product that we can deliver on Vets.gov. It should be big enough to be impactful, but small enough that we can deliver it quickly and get feedback before moving on to a larger solution.

We want to set goals that we will continually compare our solutions with to make sure we stay on track and avoid unnecessary scope creep.

This is where we will build epics for phases of work. Minimum Viable Product, to be followed by enhancements.

Things to pay attention to:
- External integration points may have their own timetables.
- Are there policy constraints that need to be explored for flexibility?

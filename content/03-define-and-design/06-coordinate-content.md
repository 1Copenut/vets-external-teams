## Content Coordination
Writing is as important as any other part of the design, and not all of it will be in your design. There are other parts of Vets.gov that may be impacted by what you are working on.
- What is your service called, is that Veteran language or VA language?
- What paths might Veterans be taking to get to your service, can they find it?
- Where would callouts to this new service might make sense?
- How will this impact overall site navigation?

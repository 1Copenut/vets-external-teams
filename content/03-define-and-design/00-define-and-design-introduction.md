title: Define and Design Your Product
label: Define & Design Intro
---

This phase of work takes the project from findings uncovered during discovery to proposed solutions that are prototyped and tested with an appropriate audience.

## Process:

1. [Review findings and scope project](): Collectivelt review findings from Discovery. Zero in on the smallest meaningful solution to the problem at hand.
1. [Diagraming and outlining](): Map out the logical flow of your product. Break the process down into bite-sized chunks and figure out the best way to order things for ease of use.
1. [Pattern recognition](): Look for similar patterns in Vets.gov. See how consistent and familiar you can make your product to someone who has been elsewhere on Vets.gov.
1. [Visual exploration](): This is optional. If you are leveraging the design system, you probably don't need to do high fidelity comps. Reserve that for situations where you need to create new patterns.
1. [Prototype and test](prototyping): Live code or clickable prototype, find the fastest and most useful way to prove out your idea. It is probably live code. Live prototypes are easier to test, and if they work for users, have made significant front end progress.
1. [Coordinate with content team](): Writing is incredibly important to the success of products. We need to write clearly in the product. We also need to consider and update the relevant static content to make the product easy to find and use.
1. [Incorporate feedback](): We almost never get it right on the first try. Tease out the underlying issues exposed by feedback sessions. Modify your prototype and test again.
1. [Document solutions](): Once you have a validated solution, document your design decisions and write tickets for remaining work.

## Listening
Solving the problems people actually have, is critical to success. Projects often come out of someone’s passion to improve services. But that perspective can omit important factors. It's important to really poke at the edges of the idea to find trouble spots early in the process.

- Talk to people on both sides of the equation
  - From the business side:
    - What do you need to from Veterans to help them?
    - What are common errors you see people make that slow or threaten delivery of benefits?
      - What is working well?
    - What technical or policy issues are a challenge?
      - Are there work-arounds that might need to adjust with new approaches?
  - From the Veteran side:
    - What parts of the process are frustrating or painful?
    - What parts are working well?








## Repeat
You probably will not get it right the first time. Cycle through this process as many times as you need to, to get to a launchable state. But at the same time, there is nothing like being live to really test if it works. Balance the level of “done-ness” you need with the mission critical nature of your service.

Every project should go through a thorough discovery process. Sometimes (always) a simple seeming project has hidden complexity.

1. Listen to business, technical stakeholders, and Veterans to really understand the problem area
2. Map out potential solutions
3. Test those solutions with all groups above
4. Apply feedback gleaned
5. Coordinate with content team and overall site architecture
6. Repeat until good enough to launch...

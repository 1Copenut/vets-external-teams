title: Documenting your Design Solution
label: Document Solution
---
We try not to do documentation for documentation's sake. But there are things that will make development of your product, and subsequent products a lot easier if written down. Documentation serves three purposes:
1. Communicating how a thing works, and looks, to developers who are making it real.
2. Recording decisions, for easier recall when having sign-off decisions later, sometimes with new participants who don't have the full project history.
3. A video walkthrough of the product is helpful for familiarizing call center staff with changes to process.
4. Your future self, or other designers, will appreciate the "what and why" being easily referencable when working on similar projects.

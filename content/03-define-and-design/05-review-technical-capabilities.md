title: Review The Technical Capabilities
label: Review Technical Capabilities

How well does the design line up with the technical limitations uncovered in discovery? Are there parts of the design that need to be reconsidered due to technical issues? Is there additional back end development that needs to happen before the project can proceed?

- Does the order the screens mean any changes to schema or imply difficult data handling?
- Does any information need to be uploaded by the user? How will that uploaded information be stored/sent?
- Does the design have any unique scenarios that arenâ€™t currently present in the Vets.gov Design Patterns?
- Can you submit structured data directly? Or do you need to create a PDF for submission? Both?
- Are any backend services that are relied upon frequently unavailable? How does that affect error messaging to the user?

Design and engineering can have a lot of impact on each other. The team should be talking about these questions frequently as the design evolves. Document changes in the product outline or a Significant Decisions doc.

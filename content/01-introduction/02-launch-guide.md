##### Keep this guide someplace handy so you can track your progress through your product’s lifecycle - checking in with stakeholders and the platform team along the way.
---
## 1. Roadmap Planning
### Expected timeframe: a couple of days
VA will need some initial information about your project to collaborate with you on prioritization. Put together a couple of sentences on your project idea and the problem it's solving, document your Project Manager and/or Business Owner and any other teammates that will be a part of this work, and what APIs and/or other services you anticipate you may want to use.

**You'll know you're done with this phase when:**
- [ ] This project information has been emailed to [Marvo Dolor](mailto:marvourneen.dolor@va.gov)

---
## 2. Discovery
### Expected timeframe: 2 - 6 weeks
Once Marvo has connected you to a DSVA Coordinator, your full implementation team is ready, and you have VA’s green light to get started, kick your project off by onboarding and starting discovery.

1. Send all teammate names, email addresses, and GitHub usernames to your DSVA Coordinator
1. Work through all 9 steps of [discovering user and business challenges and needs](../discovery/discovery-introduction)  
1. For engineers, familiarize yourself with the [Vets.gov Developer Documentation](../vets-developer-docs/getting-started)

**You'll know you're done with this phase when:**
- [ ] You've gone over the Product Outline and Discovery Findings with your DSVA Coordinator
- [ ] You've gone over your Technical Review with the Vets.gov Platform Team
- [ ] You've presented findings and solution approach to your Content POC, your IA POC, and your stakeholders

---
## 3. Definition and Design
### Expected timeframe: 2 - 6 weeks
Iterate on your solution ideas, and keep testing. Eventually, you'll have the experience fully fleshed out and validated with users, stakeholders, and engineers.

1. Work through all X steps of [designing and defining the user experience](../define-and-design/define-and-design-introduction)

### [WIP]

**You'll know you're done with this phase when:**
- [ ] The Product Outline is complete

- [ ] You've gone over the end-to-end flow with your DSVA Coordinator, the Vets.gov Platform team, and your stakeholders
- [ ] You've gone over epics and user stories with your engineering team

---
## 4. Staging
### Expected timeframe: 2 - 6 weeks
This is all about getting your application online! You’ll have the platform team’s support at this stage to help you work through any technical roadblocks, perform code reviews, and provide guidance if you have questions as you go.

1. Get added to pager duty
1. Work through all X steps of [staging and testing your application](../staging-and-testing/staging-and-testing-intro)
1. Send your Analytics needs to Mina Farzhad

VA’s overarching mission is to build products that make things easier for everyone: Veterans, VSOs, VA employees, VA Offices, and more. Start by understanding the target user’s challenges and the current journey they take to achieve their goals, and combine those findings with an understanding of the business processes needed to power any potential features. This allows for the development of a solution that best serves all parties.

In this section you’ll find guidance on defining your project, talking to users, validating requirements, and creating actionable epics and user stories to assist your team in delivering value for VA and the Veterans using your tools.

You might find it helpful to kick things off with this [Product Outline](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline), and fill it out as you go through the various phases of your product’s life cycle.

Finally, in addition to this specific Veteran-facing Tools Playbook, there are other excellent resources out there on creating user-centered government products. See the [18F Method Cards](https://methods.18f.gov) and the [Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov) for more inspiration!

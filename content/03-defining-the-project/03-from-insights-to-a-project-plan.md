Now that your team has a strong understanding of your users’ needs, you can leverage that knowledge to define project goals.

Our team uses a living document called a ‘Product Outline’ as a way to record these project goals along with the requirements, assumptions, solution approach and more. It serves as a single source of truth for your team throughout the project lifecycle. You can find and example of this document [here](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline).

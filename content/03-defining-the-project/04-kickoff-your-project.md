Congrats! You're ready to officially kickoff your new VA project! Take the project plan that you created in the last section and email it to _____@va.gov.

Make sure to title the _Subject_ of your email like this: **Kickoff - [Fill in the Blank] VA Project**

We'll get back to you within one business day to set up a 15-20 min discussion between your team and a few members of our team. This conversation will just be to make sure we have a good understanding of what you're trying to achieve and how we can best help you. If you have any questions at this point in the process, this meeting is a great time to address those items and open up a line of communication!

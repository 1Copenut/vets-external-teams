VA’s mission is to build products that make things easier for everyone: Veterans, VSOs, VA employees, VA Offices, and more. Start by understanding the target user’s challenges and the current journey they take to achieve their goals. By combining those discovery findings with an understanding of the business requirements you'll be on the optimal path for developing a solution that best serves all parties.

In this section you'll find the steps for turning your project from an idea into a project plan

title: Steps for Defining Your Project
label: Project Introduction
---
VA’s mission is to build products that make things easier for everyone: Veterans, VSOs, VA employees, VA Offices, and more. Start by understanding the target user’s challenges and the current journey they take to achieve their goals. By combining those discovery findings with an understanding of the business requirements you'll be on the optimal path for developing a solution that best serves all parties.

In this section you'll find the steps for taking your project from an idea and transforming it into an actionable plan for your team:
  1. [Understand your users' needs](./understanding-user-needs)
  1. [Validate your hypothesis through user research](./validating-hypotheses-with-research)
  1. [Transforming research insights in a project plan](./from-insights-to-a-project-plan)
  1. [Kickoff your project by meeting with (X)](./kickoff-your-project)
  1. [Set up your workflow](./set-up-your-workflow)

We recommend organizing the various aspects of your project with a [Product Outline](/docs/resources/templates/product-outline). It's a living document that you can use to capture important information and key decisions during the different phases of your product’s life cycle.

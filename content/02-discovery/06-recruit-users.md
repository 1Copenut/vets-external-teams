It’s important to hear from a representative sample of your constituency. Aim to talk to people across the full range of age, ethnicity, gender, geography, branches, service eras, and expertise that you’d expect to find in people using the tools you’re building. Consider recruiting participants in person at Veteran focused events, through VSO relationships, and even just using your personal networks via social media.

It is very helpful to have blurbs that are written with the various channels in mind. Short bites for social media, longer pieces for email. We have also made cards that we can hand out with contact details participants can use to ask about signing up for sessions.

Keep in mind that some communities can be more suspicious than others. A @va.gov email address or some personal vouching goes a long way. If you need any help recruiting, our team may be able to help you find users to interview. Please contact us at user_research@va.gov.

## Running research sessions
You need at least two people to run a research session. One person will facilitate the conversation and the other person is a designated note taker. This frees the facilitator up to concentrate on the conversation and follow it wherever it leads without trying to scribble notes along the way. Sessions can be 30 minutes or longer. More than 60 is not recommended. If meeting in person, ideally you can see the person where they typically perform the task you are investigating. But often times the sessions are virtual. We use video conferencing software that lets us share our screens with the participant.
- Reassure the participant that you are testing software, not them
- We donâ€™t want to steer the participant, but being friendly is fine!
- We try not to schedule sessions back to back, everyone needs a break. More than a couple a day can be overwhelming.

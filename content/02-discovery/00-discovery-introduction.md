title: Discovering and Validating Assumed User and VA Needs
label: Discovery Introduction
---
In this phase, the goal is to connect directly with real potential users and stakeholders to validate your assumptions on what you *think* people will find valuable, what kind of product you *think* will solve their main problems.

Remember to stay open to having your hypotheses proven wrong. Changing approach at this phase is much easier than after a product is live.

### Process:
1. [Draft personas, a problem statement, and assumptions](./problem-statements-and-assumptions): a guide to setting yourself up for Discovery, by documenting who your target users are, and what you believe to be true about their challenges and needs.
1. [Create a Product Outline](./product-outline): a living document that should become more robust as you learn more about uers and refine the product requirements. You can start it in this phase by filling in your problem statement and assumptions, and can come back to refine it and add more information at the end of Discovery when you've learned more.
1. [Document your team composition](./team-composition): a template with recommendations for what types of roles to include on your team to ensure you have the appropriate implementation and validation resources.
1. [Create a Product Charter](./product-charter): an alignment document whose purpose is to make sure your general solution approach is agreed upon by all stakeholders -- without going to deep into solution detail, since that will be further defined after Discovery.
1. <a href='https://methods.18f.gov/discover/' target="blank">Choose a research method</a>: a list of 18F's recommended Discovery methods. Browse to find a tactic that suits your projects needs, as well as instructions for how to perform that activity.
1. [Draft a research plan](./draft-research-plan): a guide for thinking through what you want to validate and learn in this research, so you're prepared to make the most of your research sessions.
1. [Recruit users](./recruit-users): a guide for the kinds of channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.
1. [Talk with users and stakeholders](./talk-with-users-and-stakeholders): tips on how to conduct research sessions.
1. [Synthesize your discovery findings](./synthesize-your-findings): a template for presenting your findings in a way that's relevant for those making product or feature decisions.
1. [Rudimentary technical review](./rudimentary-technical-review/): some initial questions for engineers to explore as a solution approach becomes clear.

By the way, as soon as you feel like you have a good understanding of your users needs, you can start on [defining and designing activities](../design-and-define/design-and-define-intro). It's ok and natural for these phases to overlap and inform each other.

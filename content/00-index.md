The VA Digital Services Platform is a collection of processes, tools, frameworks, and APIs for defining, designing, and building applications that help Veterans get the services and benefits they deserve. Here you'll find resources that can aid the development of your application, and how to develop applications directly on top of the platform that powers Vets.gov.

## Google Analytics Account Access

The name.gov team has its own Google Analytics account with detailed metrics on its program.

To request access email or DM the vets.gov analytics POC (currently Mina Farzad, mina@adhocteam.us or @minafarzad). You
will need a Google account to be granted access.
 - DSVA/USDS/VA members should provide either a Gmail account (preferably a work specific account) or their government email (if a Google Account has been associated with it)
 - Ad Hoc members should provide their @adhocteam.us emails
 - Other contractors should provide either their work email (if a Google account) or a work-specific Gmail account

Accesses will be provided to those accounts according to the person's role.

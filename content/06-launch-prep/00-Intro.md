If you’d like to build and launch a new feature on [name.gov], at a high level the process will look like this:

1. [Get access, get your repos set up, get oriented!](/docs/development-process/getting-started)
2. Leverage resources as needed in this Veteran-facing Tools Playbook to [define the product or feature](/docs/defining-the-project/intro) you’re creating
3. Email Angela Gantt-Curtis and Marvoureen Dolor to get the green light to start building
4. Submit any [ATO paperwork] *(NEEDS LINK)*
5. [Design, test] *(NEEDS LINK)*, and [build] *(NEEDS LINK)*! Also leveraging resources in this Playbook as needed.
6. As you work, create issues in the vets-contrib repo for questions, blockers, or feedback so the Platform team can support you.
7. When it’s time to launch, email Angela Gantt-Curtis and Marvoureen Dolor to set up a Go/No-Go meeting
8. [Deploy your product] *(NEEDS LINK)* or feature via a “soft launch” to track performance and metrics
9. When ready, initiate marketing web comms for a “hard launch” to drive traffic
10. Continue to monitor and track user needs, and iterate by repeating this process

There’s a lot more detail, as well as step-by-step guides, that you’ll find if you browse deeper in this section.

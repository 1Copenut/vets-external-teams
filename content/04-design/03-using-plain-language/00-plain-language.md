## “Doing” is better than “Explaining.”
Our goal is to give Veterans the tools and content they need to complete a task—quickly and easily. We're constantly asking the question “what does a Veteran want to accomplish during this visit?”

### Content Principles
Our content is:
 - Accurate
 - Written in plain language
 - Based on Veteran feedback, user research, VA call center data, and web analytics
 - Concise
 - Skimmable
 - Actionable
 - Accessible
 - Findable
 - Device agnostic

### Style Guides
> We follow the guidance and rules in the *[Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.] (http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)* (CMS), and our dictionary of choice is [*Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/) (M-W). The vets.gov Style Guide has exceptions to CMS and M-W, plain-language guidance (see Voice and Tone and Word Choice sections), a list of terms specific to VA and vets.gov, as well as government forms referenced on our site.

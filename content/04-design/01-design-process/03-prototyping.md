title: Prototyping your designs
label: Prototyping
---

We take different approaches depending on the complexity of the situation. In all cases we start with the usual discovery activities

- We don’t have a hard and fast rule for how this works, just that it is done
- Prototyping technique should balance speed with quality of feedback you can get
  - Sometimes you can do an outline and go straight to code
  - Sometimes there are novel patterns that need more fidelity to narrow options before code makes sense
    - If we are doing something totally new, we do more exploration before moving forward
  - We try to avoid sprawling hi-fidelity comps
    - They are brittle, and keeping them current is extra work
    - Branching logic is more practical to prototype in code
    - Work done in code is more likely to be reusable
    - Live code allows real Veteran entered data to test assumptions, rather than pretty demo data
- Start with small screens
  - Not every process “feels” like a mobile activity, but some folks really only have ready access to the internet through phones
  - The constraint is helpful in keeping interactions simple
- Negotiate with your team to find the right approach

Addendum:
- We use a few different tools to get this done
  - Text outlines (.csv, .md)
  - Diagrams (.sketch)
  - Visual design templates (.sketch, invision)
    - Craft logic, not hotspots

Vets.gov’s design is based on the [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) with some additional specifications to meet the needs of VA’s particular audience: Veterans and their families.

## The Design System
The Vets.gov Design System documents these design patterns and the React code to express them. Using a design system can radically simplify the process of getting to a first draft. In many cases, it allows you to skip high fidelity prototypes and go directly to code, based on text outlines of the form structure. But in cases where you may need to figure out a new pattern, you can also use a [Sketch template file](/assets/design/templates/vets-gov-pattern-library.sketch) as a starting point. It will allow you to quickly build screens using common static content and form patterns. From there you can link images together in InVision or another prototyping tool of choice.

Vets-API and Vets-Website are automatically deployed to three shared environments. Additionally, the latest changes on all Pull Requests are automatically deployed to a [Review Instance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/blob/master/Developer%20Process/Workflow.md#review-instances). Each of these deployments is connected with External Services within the VA to facilitate testing.

Even after user research, and testing designs and prototypes with users, it can be helpful to test your product in staging to see how users interact with it in their own browser. Especially for complex products, or those with brand new patterns that haven’t been tested yet through other Veteran-facing tools.

Through usability testing your product or feature in a web browser or mobile device, you may learn about new pain points. Together the team of product, design, and development minds should decide whether those pain points are severe enough that they need solving prior to launching your product, or whether they’re mild enough that you can launch the product as is and track those insights to drive future enhancements.

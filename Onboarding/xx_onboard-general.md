## Onboarding by organization

### DSVA team members (and detailees)

No need to worry! DSVA Admin (and/or your DSVA Buddy) will provide you with everything you need to get started with our culture, process, and tools.


### Internal contractor (and its subcontractors)

* Contact your Team Lead to get started.
  * TODO - fix Internal Contractor documentation so it's only about the contractor and link to it.


### VA contractors

* [Follow these steps](onboard-tools-va-contractors.md) to get team members set up with the tools they need to work on the Veteran Tools Platform.
  * *Tip*: This step should be completed by a single person on behalf of the whole team.

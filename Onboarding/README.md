# Onboarding for the Veteran Tools Platform

Choose an onboarding process based on your status (the team you're on):

* **I'm on the DSVA team (or detailed to DSVA)**
<br/>You'll be given an "Onboarding Checklist" when you start. Follow the steps to get set up.

* **I'm on DSVA's primary vendor team**
<br/>Ask your Team Lead to set you up.

* **I'm on another VA contractor team**

  * Follow the steps for [Github and Slack for VA contractors](github-and-slack.md).
  * Complete additional [onboarding steps for different types of work you'll be doing](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/delivery/onboard-team).

## Onboarding for everyone


### 1. Review the [Veteran Tools Platform Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).

If you have any questions about the Code of Conduct, your DSVA contact can answer them.


### 2. Review the [norms for communication](norms-communication.md)

There are many teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform from different organizations (DSVA, internal contractors, VA contractors).

Review these communication norms so you understand how to communicate effectively with DSVA, as well as expectations for contractor-to-contractor communication.**


### 3. Review the [Github tips and guidance](github-info.md)

Make sure you review the [Github tips](github-info.md) **before** you create your Github account.

## Onboarding by organization

### DSVA team members (and detailees)

No need to worry! DSVA Admin (and/or your DSVA Buddy) will provide everything you need to get started with our culture, process, and tools.


### Internal contractors

* Contact your Team Lead to get started.
  * TODO - fix Internal Contractor documentation so it's only about the contractor and link to it.


### VA contractors

* [Follow these steps](onboard-tools-va-contractors.md) to get team members set up with the tools they need to work on the Veteran Tools Platform.
  * *Tip*: This step should be completed by a single person on behalf of the whole team.

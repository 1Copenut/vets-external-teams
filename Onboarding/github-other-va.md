# Github onboarding for VA contractors

*Note: This process applies only to VA contractors who are not DSVA's primary vendor.**

**Tips:**
* All contractor team members must set up a Github account.
* Github accounts are subject to FOIA.
  * Set up a **new Github account** for VA work.
  * Do not use a personal Github account for VA work.
  * Do not use a previous employer Github account for VA work.
* Github requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for new accounts.
  * If you're using an older Github account without 2FA, you'll need to turn on 2FA. You may see an error when you ```git push```. [See the Github FAQs to resolve it](faqs#github).

### Create Github accounts

1. Have everyone on your team create a Github account.

2. [Use this spreadsheet](other-va-team-tracker.xlsx) to capture all names, email addresses, and Github usernames for your team.
    * Indicate which team members are developers (so we can give them access to developer code repos and tools).

3. Email the spreadsheet to your DSVA contact.

4. DSVA will add the people on the list to the VA Github organization. See [Github access](#github-access)

5. If your team is new to Github, we can arrange a short meeting to show you how to use it share documents.


### Github access

Once they've been added to the VA Github organization, team members will have access to the following Github repos.

* vets.gov-team (private, write access)
    * We'll set up a "Product" folder for your team, which you'll use to store and share project documents.
    * Your team will use Github issues in this repo to manage your agile workflow and to request tasks from the DSVA team.
* vets-ato (private, read access)
    * Provided so your team can review the current ATO documents.
* vets-website (public, developers have Write access)
* vets-api (public, developers have Write access)
* vets-json-schema (public, developers have Write access)


### Github for developers

Developers must complete <a  href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started.html#getting-started" target="_blank">additional steps</a> to access the Github code repositories and tools they'll need for development and deployment.

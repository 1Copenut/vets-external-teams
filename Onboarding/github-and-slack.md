## General information

### Github

All teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform use VA's <a title="Go to VA Github" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs" target="_blank">Github organization</a> for

1. Storing and sharing project documents. We do this to keep a record of project work and so all teams can learn from what other teams are doing.
2. Storing and sharing Work Practices &#8212; our best practices for how we do things.
3. Tracking team progress throughout the delivery process using Github Issues.
4. Keeping track of code and related version history.

#### Github Tips

* Everyone working on the Veteran Tools Platform must set up a Github account.
* Github accounts are subject to FOIA.
  * Set up a **new Github account** for VA work.
  * Do not use a personal Github account for VA work.
  * Do not use a previous employer Github account for VA work.
* Github requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for new accounts.
* If you have problems using Github, [check the Github FAQs for potential solutions](../faqs.md#github).


### Slack

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform use [Slack](https://slack.com) for day-to-day communication and collaboration. Because there are many teams working in Slack (DSVA, VA, contractors), we've established [norms for communication](norms-communication.md). **Please review these so you understand how to use Slack effectively and how to communicate with DSVA.**

## Github and Slack for VA contractors

*Note: This process applies only to those VA contractors who are not DSVA's primary vendor.*

1. Have everyone on your team create a Github account.

2. [Use this spreadsheet](other-va-team-tracker.xlsx) to capture all names, email addresses, and Github usernames for your team.
    * Indicate which team members are developers (so we can give them access to developer code repos and tools).

3. Email the spreadsheet to your DSVA contact.

4. DSVA will add the people on the list to
    * The VA Github organization. See [Github access](#github-access-for-va-contractors).
    * Slack channels relevant to your project. See [Slack access](#slack-access-for-va-contractors).

5. If your team is new to Github, we can arrange a short meeting to show you how to use it share documents.

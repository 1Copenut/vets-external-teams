# Onboarding - Github

All teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform use <a title="Go to VA Github" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs" target="_blank">Github</a> for

1. Storing and sharing project documents. We do this to keep a record of project work and so all teams can learn from what other teams are doing.
2. Storing and sharing Work Practices &#8212; our best practices for how we do things.
3. Tracking team progress throughout the delivery process using Github Issues.
4. Keeping track of code and related version history.

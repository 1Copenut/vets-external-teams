# Norms for Communication

*Notes:*
* *"Internal contractor" refers to DSVA's primary vendor contractor, e.g., AdHoc*
* *"VA contractor" refers to a contractor working with another VA team (not DSVA)*

## DSVA and internal contractor responsibilities

### DSVA authorizes access for VA contractors.

* To ensure we limit VA access to the right people, a DSVA person will add VA contractors.
  * VA contractors have [access to these items](external-team-access.md#github-repos---current) - current as of August 2018
  * If a new need arises (e.g., access to a new Github repo is needed), internal contractors will direct the request to the DSVA Product Manager, who will determine access and permissions.
  * Internal contractors cannot add VA contractors to Slack channels or to Github repos.

### DSVA and internal contractors provide support.
* DSVA and internal contractor teams will monitor the "Product" Slack channel for product-focused questions/inquiries from external contractors.
  * E.g., *#claimsmodern* for the BAH team working on 526 forms
* DSVA and internal contractor teams will monitor the "Support" Slack channel for code and other development/deployment questions from external contractors.
  * Rainbows team is assigned to be in support channel to provide support for BAH.
  * Matt/Liz will capture requests for information/questions into a "FAQs" document so that future teams can refer to it **before asking an FAQ in the *#support-external* channel**.


### Internal contractors can answer "How do I?" questions.

* How to set up and run a local dev environment
* How to access and deploy code
* How to get answers to specific code-related questions
  * The answers to "How do I?" questions are not directions; they're instructions to properly set up and use DSVA tools


### Internal contractors cannot direct VA contractor roadmaps.

Contractors cannot direct the roadmaps of other contractors or tell them what project they should work on next. For example,
* What should I be working on?
* What task should I do next?
  * If these questions come up, internal contractors should tell VA contractors to contact their own Project Manager. If there is no external Project Manager, VA contractors should contact their DSVA Product Manager.

**We do want Internal/VA contractors to collaborate because their projects will have dependencies and connections.**
* For example, an Internal contractor may provide guidance or feedback on an VA contractor's architecture so that adjustments can be made to allow dependent tools to work well together.


#### Gray areas

Questions are bound to come up that fall somewhere between "How do I?" and "What do I?" In these cases, internal contractors should direct VA contractors to the DSVA Product Manager, who will decide how to handle the request for information or question to be answered.

We will track these "gray areas," so we can document our responses to them and decrease the amount of time the DSVA Product Manager needs to spend on them in the future.

## VA contractor responsibilities

### 1. Look for documentation before posting a question in Slack (or contacting DSVA).
* See your team's Github "Product" folder or the VA Digital Service Handbook.
* If you don't find an answer, post in a Slack channel.

### 2. Use the 2 Slack channels for different purposes.

* **For product questions** use your team's "product" Slack channel (e.g., *#claimsmodern*).
  * Example question: "Where can I find previous research?",
* **For process questions**, use the *#support-external* Slack channel.
  * Example questions: "I can't get the proxy to work" or "How do I integrate this into that?" or "How do I use Zenhub to do X?"
* If you don't get a response within a few hours, ping someone you know in the channel to look at your question.
* If you don't get a response within 1 business day, contact the DSVA Product Manager, who will make sure the right people address your question.


### 3. Use best communication method.

#### Slack - best communication method
* Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
* We discourage private Slack conversations (DMs) for the same reason.
* **VA contractors should use the 2 Slack channels as their first method for contacting anyone on the DSVA or internal contractor team.**

#### Meetings - slowest communication method
* If your team has a question about something, ask it in a Slack channel.
* Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow your team down.

#### Email - least effective communication method
* Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable.
* Use this as a last resort for getting in touch with DSVA or the internal contractor team.

## Background for these decisions

### Goals

We want the system/process for VA contractor communication to be

* Reliable - VA contractors should know where to go and who to ask for information and questions
* Expert - VA contractors should expect that people assigned to answer their questions have the expertise to do so (or, know how to get the information from others with expertise)
* Timely - VA contractors should expect timely responses to requests for information and answers to questions (so we don't become a blocker to their work)

<hr>

### Problems to solve

* Contractors can't direct the work of other contractors.
* Need to minimize disruption of internal contractors (who are doing other PI work).
* Need to minimize the amount of time DSVA Product Managers spend with autonomous VA contractors.

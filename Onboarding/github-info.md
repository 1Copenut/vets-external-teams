# Github Information


### Background

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform use [Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) to

1. Store and share project documents. We do this to keep a record of project work and so all teams can learn from what other teams are doing.
2. Store and share Work Practices &#8212; our best practices for how we do things.
3. Track progress throughout the agile delivery process using Github Issues.
4. Manage code and related version history.


### Github Tips

* Everyone working on the Veteran Tools Platform must set up a Github account.
* Github accounts are subject to FOIA.
  * Set up a **new Github account** for VA work.
  * Do not use a personal Github account for VA work.
  * Do not use a previous employer Github account for VA work.
* Github requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for new accounts.
  * If you use a Github account without enabling 2FA, you're likely to have problems pushing code.
* If you have problems using Github, [check the Github FAQs for potential solutions](../faqs.md#github).

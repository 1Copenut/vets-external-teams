# Github Information


## Background

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform use [Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) to

1. Store and share project documents. We do this to keep a record of project work and so all teams can learn from what other teams are doing.
2. Store and share Work Practices &#8212; our best practices for how we do things.
3. Use Github Issues to track progress throughout the agile delivery process.
4. Manage code and related version history.


## ### Creating a Github account

1. Everyone working on the Veteran Tools Platform must set up a Github account.
1. Github accounts are subject to FOIA.
    * Set up a **new Github account for VA work.**
    * Do not use a personal Github account for VA work.
    * Do not use a previous employer Github account for VA work.
1. Github requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for new accounts.
    * If you use a Github account without enabling 2FA, you're likely to have problems pushing code.

## Using Github

### Store and share documents

GitHub is a system that stores documents and keeps a revision history of those files. It's divided into "repositories," which are groups of related files or documents. For example, this file lives in the ```vets-work-practices``` repo.

For non-developers, most of their Github work happens in the ```vets.gov-team``` repo where they store and share files.

Github makes it easy to "style" text-based documents using Markdown syntax. Learn how to use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


### Create, edit, and delete files

You can use Github by visiting the repo URL in your browser and editing files from there. Or you can use the command line to interact with files.

* If you're not familiar with Github, use the web interface to learn how Github works and what you can do with it.
* If you're not familiar with Github, review the [Github primer](github-primer.md) to learn how to do basic tasks like creating a file or submitting a pull request.


### Managing agile workflow

Each Github repo has a section called "Issues." [Learn about issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

The "Issues" section of the ```vets.gov-team``` repo is where all teams manage their Epics, User Stories, and agile workflow.

We use [Zenhub]() with Github to turn the "Issues" section into an [scrum board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)).

All teams use Zenhub to manage their agile workflow.

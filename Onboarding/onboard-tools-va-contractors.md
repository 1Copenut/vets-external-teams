# Tools Onboarding for VA Contractors

**This document applies only to contractor working on the Veteran Tools Platform who are not DSVA's primary vendor contractor (or its subcontractors).**

To work on the Veteran Tools Platform, each team member needs access to the VA Github organization and access to DSVA Slack channels.

Here's how to get started:

* [Request access to Github and Slack](#request-github-and-slack-access)
* [Understand your access](#understand-your-access)

<hr>

## Request Github and Slack access

1. Have each team member review the [tips for creating a Github account](github-info.md#tips-for-creating-a-github-account) **before creating their Github account.**

1. Have everyone on your team create a Github account.

1. [Use this spreadsheet](va-contractor-team-tracker.xlsx) to capture all names, email addresses, and Github usernames for your team.
    * Indicate which team members are developers (so we can give them access to developer code repos and tools).
    * Please rename it according to your team, e.g., BAH-team-tracker.xlsx.

1. Email the spreadsheet to your DSVA contact.

1. DSVA will add the people on the list to
    * The VA Github organization. See [Github access](#github-access-for-va-contractors).
    * Slack channels relevant to your project. See [Slack access](#slack-access-for-va-contractors).

1. Developers must complete [additional onboarding steps](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started.html#getting-started) to access the code repositories and tools they'll need for development and deployment. They should complete these steps as soon as they've received the email invitation to join the VA Github organization.

1. If your team is new to Github, we can arrange a short meeting to show you how to use it share documents.

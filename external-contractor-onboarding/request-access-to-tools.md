## Request Github and Slack access

To work on the Veteran Tools Platform, each team member needs access to the VA Github organization and access to DSVA Slack channels.

1. Have each team member review the [tips for creating a Github account](../norms-github/README.md#tips-for-creating-a-github-account) **before creating a Github account.**

1. Have everyone on the team create a Github account.

1. [Use this spreadsheet](external-contractor-team-tracker.xlsx) to capture all names, email addresses, and Github usernames for the team.
    * Indicate which team members are developers (so we can give them access to developer code repos and tools).
    * Please rename the spreadsheet according to your team, e.g., BAH-team-tracker.xlsx.

1. Email the spreadsheet to your DSVA contact.

1. DSVA will add the people on the list to
    * The VA Github organization
    * Slack channels relevant to your project

1. Developers must complete [additional onboarding steps](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started.html#getting-started) to access the code repositories and tools they'll need for development and deployment. They should complete these steps as soon as they've received the email invitation to join the VA Github organization.

1. Understand the [norms for using these tools](norms-tools) when you're working on the Veteran Tools Platform.


#### Tip:

* If your team is new to Github, we can arrange a short meeting to show you how to use it share documents.

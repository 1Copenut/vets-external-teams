# Norms for Communication

**This document applies to the DSVA team (including detailees) and any contractor working on the Veteran Tools Platform.**

**Definitions for terms used in this document:**

* *"DSVA" refers to DSVA team members and DSVA detailees.*

* *"Internal Contractors" refers to DSVA's primary vendor contractor (e.g., AdHoc) and its subcontractors.*

* *"External Contractors" refers to any other contractor team working on the Veteran Tools Platform.*

## DSVA and Internal Contractor responsibilities

### DSVA authorizes access for External Contractors.

* To ensure we limit VA access to the right people, a DSVA person will add External Contractors.
  * If a new need arises (e.g., access to a new Github repo is needed), direct the request to the DSVA Product Manager, who will determine access and permissions.
  * Internal Contractors cannot add External Contractors to Slack channels or to Github repos.

### DSVA and Internal Contractors provide support.
* DSVA and Internal Contractor teams will monitor the "Product" Slack channel for product-focused questions/inquiries from External Contractors.
  * E.g., *#claimsmodern* for the External Contractor team working on 526 forms
* DSVA and Internal Contractor teams will monitor the "Support" Slack channel for development, deployment, and project management questions from External Contractors.


### Internal Contractors can answer "How do I?" questions.

For example,
* How to set up and run a local dev environment
* How to access and deploy code
* How to get answers to specific code-related questions

The answers to "How do I?" questions are not directions; they're instructions to properly set up and use DSVA tools.


### Internal Contractors cannot direct External Contractor roadmaps.

Contractors cannot direct the roadmaps of other contractors or tell them what project they should work on next. For example,
* What should I be working on?
* What task should I do next?

If these questions come up, Internal Contractors should tell External Contractors to contact their own Project Manager.

**We do want Internal/External Contractors to collaborate because their projects will have dependencies and connections.**
* For example, an Internal Contractor may provide guidance or feedback on an External Contractor's architecture so that adjustments can be made to allow dependent tools to work well together.


#### Gray areas

Questions are bound to come up that fall somewhere between "How do I?" and "What do I?" In these cases, Internal Contractors should direct External Contractors to the DSVA Product Manager, who will decide how to handle the question/request.

We will track these "gray areas," so we can document our responses to them and decrease the amount of time the DSVA Product Manager needs to spend on them in the future.

## External Contractor responsibilities

### 1. Look for documentation before posting a question in Slack (or contacting DSVA).
* See your team's Github "Product" folder or the VA Digital Service Handbook.
* If you don't find an answer, post in a Slack channel.


### 2. Use the 2 Slack channels for different purposes.

* **For product questions** use your team's "product" Slack channel (e.g., *#claimsmodern*).
  * Example question: "Where can I find previous research?"
* **For process questions**, use the *#support-external* Slack channel.
  * Example questions: "I can't get the proxy to work" or "How do I integrate this into that?" or "How do I use Zenhub to do X?"
* If you don't get a response within a few hours, ping someone you know in the channel to look at your question.
* If you don't get a response within 1 business day, contact the DSVA Product Manager, who will make sure the right people address your question.


### 3. Use best communication method.

#### Slack - best communication method
* Slack channels allow us to do our work in the open so that others can learn from the questions asked and the answers provided. Please do the same.
* We discourage private Slack conversations (DMs) for the same reason.
* **External Contractors should use the 2 Slack channels as their first method for contacting anyone on the DSVA or Internal Contractor team.**


#### Meetings - slowest communication method
* If your team has a question about something, ask it in a Slack channel.
* Don't wait to organize a meeting to ask a question; this will slow your team down.


#### Email - least effective communication method
* Email communications are not easily searchable or archivable.
* Use this as a last resort for getting in touch with DSVA or the Internal Contractor team.

## Background for these decisions

### Goals

We want the system/process for External Contractor communication to be

* Reliable - External Contractors should know where to go and who to ask for information and questions
* Expert - External Contractors should expect that people assigned to answer their questions have the expertise to do so (or, know how to get the information from others with expertise)
* Timely - External Contractors should expect timely responses to requests for information and answers to questions (so we don't become a blocker to their work)

<hr>

### Problems to solve

* Contractors can't direct the work of other contractors.
* Need to minimize disruption of Internal Contractors (who are doing other program work).
* Need to minimize the amount of time DSVA Product Managers spend with autonomous External Contractors.
